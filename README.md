# What is this ?

First time I am actually creating SVG inside an HTML file. Before that I used to just import SVG images and have trouble using them because I did not really care how they worked. I have decided to actually create something in SVG, and manipulate it using JS, in order to familiarize myself with that technology.

# What will you be doing ?

Simple animated SVG clock.

If you _click_ on the date of the day then it toggles to show you if you are in "PM" or "AM". Event though the time is shown underneath I still found it useful.
